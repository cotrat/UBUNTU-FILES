The code seems to be well structured and it is quite easy to follow logical paths to find the classes from which
particular methods come from. The code also appears to be quite well commented which will help a lot with understanding what certain methods/parts of the code do as there is quite a lot of code to try and understand. The code would definitely need to be read in small pieces multiple times to gather a full understanding of whats happening, especially in regards to how the the GUI is set up (but this is second to understanding how all of the classes actually function). It can be quite hard to comprehend what exactly is going on in classes such as those found under the 'road' group whereas the 'entity' and 'event' classes and methods are more straightforward. It can also be quite difficult to find out exactly how classes interract with eachother, having not been a part of the development process, rather just being given the code to analyse.

One quite obvious bug in the code is that taxis do not function properly, in fact they seem to not be appearing at all, along with not stopping at the rank properly (no passengers are picked up). To fix this bug one would need to look into how the 'taxi' objects are being created and implemented. There could be multiple reasons why taxis fail to appear, the function is being called incorrectly, they are never allocated to lanes, or any of a number of reasons. It is hard at this stage to determine how difficult it may be to fix as there is a lot of related classes so it may be hard to find where in the 'chain' the bug actually is, one would assume however that the issue is in one of the events which handle the creation/adding of vehicles to lanes.
